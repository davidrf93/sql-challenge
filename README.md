Challengen 9 m- SQL
Data Engineering
The schemas for creating the six tables in the data base can be found in schema.sql.

dept_no and title_id/emp_title_id and sex are VARCHARs because they have a fixed length.
All other strings are TEXT because they could have a variable length.
first_name, last_name, could potentially be NULL as there is no guarantee that a person has a name1. However, for this data set, I will be using NOT NULL.
